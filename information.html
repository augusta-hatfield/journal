    <h1>Information about the mood meter</h1>
The Mood Meter is a tool developed by psychologists at Yale. It originated from research into emotional intelligence, aiming to help people identify and understand their feelings by categorizing emotions along two key dimensions: pleasantness and energy. The Mood Meter is typically divided into four colored quadrants—red, yellow, green, and blue—each representing different types of emotions, from high energy and unpleasant (red) to low energy and pleasant (green). By using this visual framework, people can better recognize their emotional states, improve self-awareness, and develop strategies to manage emotions more effectively in daily life.
